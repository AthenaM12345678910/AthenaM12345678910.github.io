          <li> Crocs have two modes: leisure mode, when the strap is normal, and adventure mode, when the strap is behind the heel. </li>
          <li> Most are extremely stylish and pose no sort of fashion threat to you.</li>
          <li> Crocs are the most comfortable shoes that can be found or made.</li>
          <li> Crocs can easily be customized to your own liking.</li>

          <li> Crocs can make your feet sweaty, but that's your problem. Don't try to blame the perfect Crocs for your bad case of Athlete's foot. Crusty.</li>
          <li> Some people customize their Crocs horribly. Don't be that person.</li>
